Main Components in Pseudocode:

    Main Menu:
        Display options for adding, retrieving, and deleting passwords.
        Get user input and call the appropriate function.

    Add Password:
        Prompt user for service_name, username, and password.
        Encrypt the password.
        Save the service_name, username, and encrypted password to the file.

    Retrieve Password:
        Prompt user for service_name or username.
        Search the file for the matching entry.
        Decrypt and display the password.

    Delete Password:
        Prompt user for service_name or username.
        Remove the entry from the file.

Key Points:

    Encryption/Decryption: The example uses XOR encryption for simplicity. You can replace it with a more secure algorithm.
    File I/O: The passwords are stored in a simple text file (passwords.txt), but you could improve this by storing the data in a more secure format.
    User Interaction: The program takes user input to add, retrieve, and delete passwords
